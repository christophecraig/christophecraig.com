  heading: Hi.
  text: "I'm Christophe, a French/Kiwi depending on who asks. I was born in Wellington
    but grew up, studied and started working in France. After finishing my second
    two year diploma in software development, I wanted to travel a bit around the
    world and even managed to get 7 of my friends on board to join me 6 months later.
    \n\nAnd Covid happened. \n\nCan't be complaining too much of course, as we probably
    are in the best place to live this nightmare, but I just miss them.\n\nAnyways,
    after all came back to normal here, I started looking for a job where I could
    meet people and become confident enough in my English. Which I absolutely am now
    \U0001F44C\n\nI met nice people who I became friends with and travelled with them
    for a couple of months in the South Island. I am now ready to get back to the
    North Island, after these long, amazing and relaxing holidays which I will never
    forget."
