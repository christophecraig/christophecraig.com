## The Project

Built a portfolio site for a professional photographer. The main goal was to showcase photos with minimal loading times.

## Technical Challenges

- **Image optimization**: modern formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallback
- **Smart lazy loading** for galleries
- **Scroll-triggered animations** between photos

## Tech Stack

- Astro for static generation
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Sharp for automatic image optimization

The site achieves a Lighthouse performance score of 98/100.
